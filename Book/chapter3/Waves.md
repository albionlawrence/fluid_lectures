# Waves in fluids

We ar all familiar with the basic phenomena of *waves* in a fluid: a 
series of finite disturbances, often spaced regularly, propagating through
the fluid. Some examples include:

- Surface waves that we see on the beach are an obvious example, or
that appeal when we drop a stone in he water; the oscillatory motion 
can be driven by gravity or surface tension.

- Sound comes from propagating compression-rarefaction waves in the air.

- Tidal forcing interacting wih complex bottom topography of the ocean
generates a complicated spectrum of *internal gravity waves* propagating
through the global ocean.

[Caption: *"This animation shows density layers in the South China Sea being perturbed by the regular back-and-forth tidal flow through the Luzon Strait. These leads to large amplitude internal waves (shown in red underwater, and in white when seen from above), being radiated west to the Chinese continental shelf. "*.]

- *Rossby waves* (which we will not cover) are planetary-scale waves in which
the Earth's rotation (and the associated Coriolis force) plays a central role.
These are responsible for the undulation of atmospheric jets such as the jet stream bounding the polar vortex, as you can see at [this website](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/rossby-wave.html).

The goal of this chapter is to explain the physics of water waves. Along the way we wil encounter a number of important mathematical techniques and concepts 
whose utility extends well beyon hydrodynamics:
- Linearization of nonlinear equations
- Dispersion relations $\omega(k)$, Phase and group velocity
- Ray tracing and the method of characteristics
- Nonlinear waves and solitons

So we will be spending a bit of time on this subject!
