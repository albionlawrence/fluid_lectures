# Internal gravity waves

An important class of waves in the ocean (and atmosphere) are *internal 
gravity waves*, waves which appear in *stratified fluids*, 
with a density increasing with depth, so that bouyancy forces act on 
fluid parcels. (For frequencies close to the "inertial frequency" 
$f = 2\Omega\sin\theta$, where $\Omega$ is the rotational 
frequency of he earth, and $\theta$ the latitutde, these are
called *inertia-gravity waves*; in these the Coriolis foce plays an
important role in the wave dynamics.)

In the ocean, the main driver of such waves is a combination of wind 
exciting waves at the inertial frequency, and tidal forcing interacting with
complex bottom topography. Subsequent nonlinear interactions in the ocean --
interactions between waves, interactions between waves and turbulent 
motion -- generates a near-continuum of gravity waves at every frequency
between the inrtial frequency and the *Brunt-V&auml;is&auml;l&auml; frequency*
which we will define below. This continuum is known as the *Garrett-Munk* 
continuum (see for example {cite:p}`Garrett1979-li` and prior papers by those authors therein. A nice review of internal waves and this continuum can be found in [this out-of-print article](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-12-000-evolution-of-physical-oceanography-spring-2007/part-2/wunsch_chapter9.pdf) by Walter Munk.)

Here we will ignore the effects of the earth's rotation and concentate on bouyancy-driven waves which, as we will see, already leads to unexpected behavior.

## Equations of motion

We start from a background state in which he fluid is at rest, and the density
has a profile $\rho_0(z)$. The only nontrivial equation is the $z$ component
of the Navier-Stokes equation,

$$
	- \frac{1}{\rho_0} \frac{\partial p_0(z)}\partial_z} - gz = 0
$$

(The other components of the equation simply require $p_0$ to have no 
$x$- or $y$-dependence.

We will consider perturbations which are independent of the $y$ direction,
and controlled by a small parameter $\epsilon$. Thus,

\begin{align}
  u(x,z,t) & = & \epsilon u_1(x,z,t) + \epsilon^2 u_2(x,z,t) + \ldots\\
