# Shallow water equations 2

Now that we have discussed the method of characteristics and found
characteristic equations for invariants $u \pm 2c$, we consider two 
applications: the flow caused by a dam break; and the formation of
a tidal bore.

## Dam break 

Consider, for $t <0$, a static situation wth water at constant height $h_0$
for $x < 0$, behind a dam at $x = 0$, and no water for $x > 0$. Then
we remove the dam and let the water begin to flow.

For $t < 0$ the characteristics are quite simple: $c_0 = \sqrt{g h_0}$, so
$\p_s t = 1$, $\p_s x = u \pm c_0$ are the characteristics along which
$u \pm 2 c_0$ are constant. Note that $u = 0$, so that 

$$
	d_t x = u \pm c_0 = \pm c_0
$$

are the characteristics: these are straight lines covering the 
quadrant $x < 0, t < 0$.

Now let us release the dam at $t = 0$.
