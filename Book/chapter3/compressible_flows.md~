While most of this course foused on incompressible flows, it is worth
spending a little time on compressible flows one encounters in particular
in gas dynamics. In this section we'll focus on the inviscid limit. The
Euler equations are as before:

$$
 \partial_t {\vec v} +_ {\vec v}\cdot{\vec \nabla} {\vec v} = - \frac{1}{\rho} {\vec \nabla} p + {\vec F}_{ext}\ ,
$$

but the continuity equation is

$$
	\partial_t \rho + {\vec nabla}\cdot(\rho {\vec v}) = 
	\partial_t \rho + {\vec v}\cdot{\vec \nabla} \rho +
	\rho {\vec \nabla}\cdot{\vec v} = 0
$$

and the final term does not in general vanish. Finally, to close these
equations, we will need some kinf of equation of state $p = p(\rho)$.
In general $p$ will depend on othe themrodynamic variables such as temperature
as well, in which case we will need equations for those quantities;
we are assuming here that those are fixed. Two candidate equations of state 
are:

$$
	p = \rho T
##

for an isothermal ideal gas; suc gases will have heat 
exchange between warmer compressed regions and colder rarified regions.
Another, for cases of no heat exchange, is the adiabatic gas law

$$
	p = C \rho^{\gamma}
$$

which turns out to be more relevant for sound waves. For this case, we can
define the *speed of sound* $c_s$ via:

$$
	c_s^2 = \frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho} \Big|_{fixed\ entropy} 
$$

For the equation of state above, 

$$
	c_s^2 = \gamma C \rho^{\gamma - 1} = \frac{\gamma p}{\rho}
$$

We will see below why we idenify this with the speed of sound waves.

## Sound waves

Once again we start from a static solution with constant density and pressure:
${\vec v} = 0$, $p= p_0$,  $\rho = \rho_0$, with backgound speed of sound 
$ c_{s0}^2 = \gamma p_0/\rho_0$. We expand

\begin{align}
	{\vec v} & = \eps \vv_1 + \eps^2 \vv_2 + \ldots\\
	\rho & = \rho_0 + \eps \rho_1 + \eps^2 \rho_2 + \ldots\\
	p & = p_0 + \eps p_1 + \eps^2 p_2 + \ldots
\end{align}

The Euler nd mass conservation equations are satisfied to order 
${\cal O}(\eps^0)$. At ${\cal O}(\eps)$, the equations are:

\begin{align}
	& \partial_t \vv_1 = - \frac{1}{\rho_0} {\vec\nabla} p_1\\
	& \partial_t \rho_1 + \rho_0 {\vec\nabla}\cdot{\vec v} = 0\\
	& p_1 = c_{s0}^2 \rho_1
\end{align}

Taking thecurl of the first equation, we have 
$\partial_t {\vec \nabla} \times \vv_1 = 0$, so hat vorticity is conserved.
If we perturb our system with irrotational flow, it remains irrotational,
so let us do hat. we can then wrote $\vv_1 = {\vac\nabla}\phi_1$, and
our equations become:

\begin{align}
	& \partial_t {\vec \nabla} \phi_1 + \frac{c_{s0}^2}{\rho_0} 
	{\vec\nabla} \rho_1 = 0\\
	\partial_t \rho_1 + \rho_0 {\vac\nabla}^2 \phi_1 = 0
\end{align}

The first equation is in fact a pure gradient:

$$
	{\vec \nabla} \left(\partial_t \phi_1 + \frac{c_{s0}^2}{\rho_0} \rho_1\right) = 1
$$

The term in parentheses is therefore a funciton of time only. defining this as 
$D(t)$, if we redfine $\phi_1 \to \phi_1 - \int_0^t dt' D(t')$, then the velocities do not change, and we have

$$
	\partial_yt \phi_1 + \frac{c_{s0}^2}{\rho_0} \rho_1 = 0
$$

Taking the time derivative of this equation and inserting the conservation
equation we are left with the wave equation

$$
	\partial_t^2\phi_1 - c_{s0}^2 {\vec \nabla}^2 \phi_1 = 0
$$

### Plane wave solutions

Let us consider waves propaating in three dimensions, with boundaries at 
infinity. We can attempt a separation of variables:

$$
	\phi_1 = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)T(t)
$$

Inserting this into the wave equation and dividing by $\phi_1$, we find:

$$
	{\ddot T}{T} - c_{s0}^2 
	\left(\frac{X''(x)}{X} + \frac{Y''(y)}{Y} + \frac{Z''(z)}{Z} \right) = 0
$$

Each term depends on an independent variable and thus must be equal to a
constant. Thus, we define

$$
	\frac{X''(x)}{X} = - k_x^2
$$

and similarly for $Y,Z$. For the solution to remain finie at infinity,
we must have $k_x^2 > 0$, so that a general solution to the above is

$$
	X = {\rm Re} X_0 e^{i k_x x}
$$

More generally, we have

$$
	X Y Z = {\rm Re} (A e^{- i {\vec k} \cdot {\vec x}
$$

(the minus sign is conventional). Finally, we have 

$$
	\frac{\ddot T}{T} = - c_{s0}^2 {\vec k}^2
$$

Defining $\omega = c_{s0} \sqrt{\vec k}^2$, we have the solution:

$$
	\phi_1 = {\rm Re} (C e^{i \omega t - i {\vec k} \cdot{\vec x}
$$

Now let us consider the case of wave smoving purely in the $x$ direction 
($k_y = k_z = 0$)
