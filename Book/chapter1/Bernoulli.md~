# Bernoulli's Equation

## 1. Isentropic motion

Here we will make recourse to a bit of thermodynamics. We can define
the *enthalpy$ as
```{math}
:label: enthalpy
W = E + p V
```
where $E$ is the inernal energy. Using the first law of thermodynamics,
$dE = T dS - p d V$, where $S$ is the entropy, we find
```{math}
:label: denth
dW = T dS + V dp = T dS + \frac{1}{\rho} dp
```
For "isentropic" fluids, with no input of hea and no heat exchange between
fluid parcels, $dS = 0$ for each parcel, and $\frac{dp}{d\rho} = dW$. Thus
```{math}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} {\vec v} + {\vec v} \cdot {\vec \nabla}
{\vec v} = - {\vec \nabla} W
```

## 2. Bernoulli's theorem.

Let us consider a velocity field ${\vec v}$ which is constant in time.
In this case, the trajectories of fluid parcels follow the streamlines
of the velocity field. In this case, *Bernoulli's theorem* states that
$W + \frac{1}{2} {\vec v}^2$ is constant along streamlines.

The proof starts with the vector identity
$$
	{\vec A} \times ({\vec \nabla}\times {\vec B}) = 
	A^i {\vec \nabla} B_i - {\vec A} \cdot {\vec \nabla} {\vec B}
$$
(where we have used Einstein summation notation). Applying this to 
${\vec A} = {\vec B} = {\vec v}$. 
$$
	{\vec v} \times ({\vec \nabla} \times {\vec v}) = 
	\frac{1}{2} {\vec \nabla} {\vec v}^2 - {\vec v} \cdot{\vec \nabla}
	{\vec v}
$$
Applying this to the Euler equation, and taking the case 
$\partial_t {\vec v} = 0$, we find
$$
{\vec \nabla} (W + \frac{1}{2} {\vec v}^2) = {\vec v} \times({\vec \nabla}\times{\vec v})
$$
Now the RHS is perpendicular to ${\vec v}$ since is a cross product with this
vector, and thus
$$
	{\vec v} \cdot {\vec \nabla}  (W + \frac{1}{2} {\vec v}^2) = 0
$$
But ${\vec v} \cdot {\vec \nabla}$ corresponds precisely to the derivative
along streamlines.
