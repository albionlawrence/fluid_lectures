# Vorticity Dynamics

The vorticity itself has dynamics which gives additional information about fluid flows.
In some cases it is either a conserved quantity or a piece of a concerved quantity.

## Circulation and Kelvin's theorem

We will work mostly with $d = 3$ but much of this holds in $d = 2$.

For some initial time $t_0$, consider a closed loop $L$ of fluid particles. As these evolve in time (at least for short
enough times), the particles will evolve to lie along a new loop $L(t)$. We define the *circulation*
as

\begin{align}
	C(t) & = & \oint_{L(t)} d{\vec \ell}\cdot {\vec v(t)}\\
	& = & \int_{A(t)} d{\vec A} \cdot ({\vec \nabla}\times {\vec v})\\
	& = & \int_{A(t)} d{\vec A} \cdot {\vec \omega}(t)
\end{eqalign}

which captures the par of the velocity field that is running along the loop $L$.
Here $\partial A = L(t)$, and $A$ is arbitrary; the second line follows from Stoke's theorem.
$d{\vec A}$ denotes an infinitesimal area element on A, with the direction perpendicular to that element.
In two dimensions we would replace $d{\vec A} \cdot {\vec \omega}$ with $dA \omega$. 

Now

$$
	d_t C(t) = \oint \left(d_t ({\vec v}) \cdot d{\vec \ell}(t) + {\vec v} \cdot d_t d{\vec \ell}(t)\right)
$$
