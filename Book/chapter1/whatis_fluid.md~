# What is a Fluid?

## Characterization

I highly recommend the introductory chapter of Batchelor's book 
{cite:p}`batchelor2000introduction` `for an 
in-depth discussion of this issue.

### A *continuous medium* with material at every point.
  
  This is of course a mathematical abstraction. A fluid is comprised of
  individual molecules and at sufficiently short distances the continuum
  approximation breaks down. In practice fluid mechanics is a *coarse-grained*
  description of materials.
  
  The assumption is that if we coarse-grain over a large enough volume, the
  material can be effectively described by a set of quantities which vary
  smoothly in space and time, eg:
    1. *velocity*: ${\vec v}({\vec x},t)$
	2. *density*: $\rho({\vec x},t)$ (we will often take this to be constant)
	3. *temperature*: $T({\vec x},t)$ 
	4. For ocean water, *salinity* (salt content): $S({\vec x},t)$
	5. For the atmosphere, *specific humidity* $q = \rho_{vapor}/\rho$.
  and so on.

### Deformation under shear

Fluids always deform under *shear stress*: essentially, a gradient of force
across some planar surface. There may be friction, corresponding to a 
force between two layers sliding on top of each other, but there is no 
restoring force.
  
## Examples

Note that for our purposes, a fluid could be a liquid, a gas, a plasma, and
so on.  Examples of fluids:

  1. Planetary fluids: oceans, atmospheres, ice sheets, magma
  2. Astrophysics and cosmology: protons and electrons in the 
  early universe, solar interiors, accretion disks, protoplanetary disks,
  near-horizon geometry of black holes (spacetime as an effective fluid)
  3. Condensed matter physics: superfluids, quantum hall fluids
  4. Biological media (blood, mucous,...)
  5. Plasma in heavy ion collisions

In other words this subject is everywhere: biological physics, soft and
hard condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, cosmology,
earth science, and so on.
