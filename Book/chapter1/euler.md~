# Equations for Ideal Fluids

We will derive the equations of fluid dynamics somewhat more systematically 
later in the course. Our goal here is to write down some basic equations
and make them plausible. Recommended texts: {cite:p}`chorin1990mathematical,falkovich_2018,salmon1998lectures`.

## 1. Variables

### A. Lagrangian description

In the continuum hypothesis we can consider a fluid as a collecion of
infiniesimal parcels. Each parcel will have a trajectory ${\vec x}(t)$,
and an associated velocity
```{math}
:label: lag_vel
{\vec v}({\vec x}(t),t) = \frac{d}{dt} {\vec x}(t)
```
We then assign each fluid particle a density $\rho({\vec x}(t), t)$,
temperature, and so on. The description is natural in terms of understanding
a fluid as a collection of parcels which are acted on by external forces
and by each other. It is also natural for certain types of measurements
such as [autonomous floats](http://www.argo.net/) in oceanography, and in
understanding the transport of materials (pollutants in the ocean and 
atmosphere).

### B. Eulerian description

In practice we often cannot or do not follow fluid parcels; rather we take
measurements at points in space and time as determined by our apparatus:
oceanographic moorings, measurements taken from ships or airplanes, and so on.
The description of fluid quantities ${\vec v}({\vec x},t)$, $\rho({\vec x}, t)$
at points in space and time is known as the *Eulerian description*.
This description is the dominant one used in fluid dynamics. It is
also the natural framework in which to do numerical experiments.

## 2. Equations

```{math}
:label: newton_second
\frac{d}{dt} {\vec p} = {\vec F}
```

where ${\vec p}$ is the momentum of a fluid parcel, and ${\vec F}$ is the
force acting on this parcel. We also assume that the mass of the parcel is
conserved: its density $\rho$ and volume $\delta V$ can change with time,
but 
```{math}
:label: mass_cons
\frac{d}{dt} m({\vec x}(t).t) = \frac{d}{dt} \rho \delta V = 0
```

### A. Continuity equation

Consider a fluid inside a fixed volume $W$. The total mass inside this volume
is 
```{math}
:label: mass_euler
M(W,t) = \int_W d^d \rho({\vec x},t)
```
Because the volume is fixed, 
```{math}
:label: mass_change
\frac{d}{dt} M = \int_W d^d x \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}
```
On the other hand, the total rate of mass flux into the volume is the
density times the velocity flux through the boundary 
surface ${\partial W}$:

\begin{align}
	\frac{d}{dt} M & =  - \int_{\partial W} d{\vec A}\cdot \rho {\vec v}\\
	& = \int_W d^d x {\vec \nabla} \cdot (\rho {\vec v})
\end{align}

where we have used the divergence theorem to rewrite the surface integral.
These definitions of $d_t M$ must be the same for any volume $W$, so we
finally have the continuity equation:
```{math}
:label: continuity
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + {\vec \nabla}\cdot (\rho {\vec v}) = 0
```

The focus of this course (not exclusive!) will be on  *incompressible fluids*. 
We can define these as fluids for which the density of a parcel does not 
change along a trajectory. In this case,
```{math}
:label: incomp
\frac{d}{dt} \rho({\vec x}(t), t) = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} 
\rho + {\vec v}\cdot {\vec\nabla} \rho \equiv D_t \rho = 0
```
Note that here we have defined he *convective derivative*


Combining this with the continuity equation gives us
```{math}
:label: nodiv
{\vec \nabla}\cdot {\vec v} = 0
```
Note that Acheson defines an ideal fluid as having constant
density. This plus the continuity equation implies that the velocity is
dovergence-free. In other references incompressibility, and not
constant density, is part of the crierion for an ideal fluid. We 
should note that there are important examples
of incompressible fluids which have variable density.

### B. Euler's equation

The next step is to write dynamical equations for the motion of the fluid.
We start with Newton's laws for a parcel. If the momentum is
```{math}
{\vec p} = M {\vec v}({\vec x}(t), t) = \rho \delta V {\vec v}({\vec x}(t), t)
```
then combining mass conservation with the chain rule, we find:
```{math}
\frac{d {\vec p}}{dt} = \delta V \rho \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}
{\vec v} + {\vec v}\cdot {\vec \nabla} {\vec v}\right) 
```
This is set equal to the force on the parcel. 

To complete the equations, we need an expression for the force
on a fluid parcel.  The force will get contributions from sources 
external to the fluid, such as gravity, and from the force due to 
neighboring parcels.

If we take the external force *per unit mass* on the particle to 
be ${\vec f}$, the total force will ${\vec F} = \rho \delta V {\vec f}$. 
An important example is a constant gravitational field acting on
the fluid, for which ${\vec f} = - g {\vec z}$, where $g$ is the gravitational
acceleration amd ${\vec z}$ the vertical direction.

An *ideal fluid*, in addition to being incompressible, is one in which 
the force exerted on a fluid parcel by neighboring parcels takes a specific
form. In particular, there is no shear stress exerted by one parcel on another:
the force is always perpendicular to the surface of the parcel, and takes the
form 
```{math}
{\vec f}_A = - p({\vec x},t) {\hat n}
```
where $p$ is some scalar quantity and ${\vec n}$ is he unit normal pointing
outward from the surface boundary. Noe that by Newton's thurd law, the
parcel will exert the force $p({\vec x},t) {\hat n}$ on the neighboring
parcel, for which $-{\hat n}$ is the unit normal pointing outwards from
that parcel. Integating ${\vec f}_A$ over the surface of the parcel, 
we find the total force on a parcel in volume $W$ is
```{math}
{\vec F} = - \int_{{\partial W}} d{\vec A} p = - \int_W
{\vec \nabla} p \sim - \delta V {\vec \nabla} p
```
where $\delta V$ is the volume of $W$. We identify $p$ with the *pressure*. 
Adding all of the forces together and dividing the whole momentum
equation by $\rho$ we get *Euler's equation*:
```{math} 
D_t {\vec v} = - \frac{1}{\rho} {\vec \nabla} p 
- \frac{1}{\rho} {\vec F}_{ext}
```
