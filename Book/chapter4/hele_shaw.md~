# Thin film example: the Hele-Shaw cell

We first consider the example of plates at constant vertical coordinates 
$z = 0,h$, with fluid driven by horizontal pressure gradients, and rigid 
objects placed in the cell that the fluid must flow around (we take these
to be straigt in the vertical direction). 

In this case $u,v$ must vanish due to the  no-slip boundary conditions at 
$z = 0,h$. In the previous section, this fixes $A,B,C,D$ so that 

\begin{align}
	& u = - \frac{z(h-z)}{2\nu} \p_x p\\
	& v = - \frac{z(h-z)}{2\nu} \p_y p
\end{align}
