# Flows at low Reynolds number

In our discussion of wave motion we have been focusing on the inviscid limit
of the fluid equations. There is much more to say about this limit, which is
important for many "real-world" ("real-universe?") applications. 

To fill out our picture of the range of fluid motion, we will spend osme time
considering flows with extremely *low* viscosity.
