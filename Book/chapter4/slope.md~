# Thin film flow on a slope

```{math}
\newcommand{\p}{\partial}

The next example we visit is that of a thin film of water on an inclined plane.
There are a few notable features of this problem:
  - As compared to previous problems, we have an external force (gravity).
  - We will be interested in the time-evolving profile of the film.
  We will find that this is described by a nonlinear differential equation in
  space and time, despite the fact that the creeping flow equations are
  linear and have no time derivative.
  
We consider an inclined plane with slope $\alpha$ under the force of gravity,
which we take ot act with force $-m g {\hat z}'$ where ${\hat z}'$ is the 
vertical diection. We consider 2d flow, with one vertical and one horizontal
direction. As with the treatment of the flow of a river, we work in coordinates
$(x,z)$ along and perpendicular to the plane.

The thin film equations now include the gravitational force:

\begin{align}
	& - \p_x p + \nu \nabla^2 u + \rho g \sin\alpha = 0\\
	& - \p_z p - \rho g \cos\alpha = 0\\
	& \p_x u + \p_z w = 0
\end{align}

where, in this approximation, we drop the viscosity term in the
vertical momentum equation. We take the fluid profile to be defined
by $z = h(x,y)$

The second equation is straightforward to solve:

$$
	p = - \rho g z \cos\alpha + f(x,t)
$$

Next we need to consider the boundary conditions. At the plane they are the
no-slip and no-flux conditions $u = w = 0$. At the free surface we need to 
impose diffrent boundary conditions. We assume that the normal stress
at the interface $z = h(x,y)$ is equal to the atmospheric pressure, and that the
tangential viscous stress *vanishes*. (This would be different
if the air was replaced by a high-viscosity fluid; then there can
be tangential voiscous stress). 

To impose this, we assume that the slope *of the film* with respect to the
inclined plane is small. This means we can take the direction perpendicular
to the film to be $\sim {\hat z}$ and the direction tangent to
the film to be $\sim {\hat x}$. The boundary conditions at the free surface
then become

\begin{align}
	p(z - h)
