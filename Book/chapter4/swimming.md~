# Swimming at low Reynolds number

As we have argued, the fluid flow as $Re \to 0$ is
fixd completely by the boundary conditions at that time. 
The only way for an object to move forward at low Reynolds number
through some kind of repetitive motion is if it executes a protocol 
which takes a *loop* in the space of possible shapes. 
So, a single paddle will not do; a *flexible* paddle might, or 
two independent hinges.

Oher option are available -- fo example, a rotating corkscrew. We'll look at 
a simpler one, which is a wave traveling along a flexible membrane.

## Waving of a think flexible sheet

We consider 2d flow again, with a membrane extended along teh $x$ direction
which is waving in the $y$ direction. We ignore, for now, the finite size
of his object. We wish to show tha this motion induces both oscillatory
flow of the fluid and an additional steady flow along the $x$ axis.
We can then boost into te rest frame of the steady flow, so that the
membrane itself is swimming in the $-x$ direction.

We take the membrane shape to be:

$$
	y = a \sin(kx - \omega t)
$$
