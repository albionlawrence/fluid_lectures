# Stokes Drag

## Introduction: 

A feature of low-viscosity flow past an object is that the drag is
*linea* in the velocity of te object (or of the flow past a stationary object).
This is already apparent in dimensional analysis; to get a force per unit
mass due to the flow, we need a quantity with dimensions of $m/s^2$.
Now, balancing the pressure term against the viscosity, 


$$
	\frac{{\vec\nabla p}}{\rho} = \nu \nabla^2 {\vec u}
$$

and using the dimensionalization we found last time, we deduce
that $p \sim \rho \nu U/R$. This is the pressure per unit area, so the
force on our object is of order $p R^2 \sim \rho\nu U R \equiv \nu U R$.

We will verify this explicitly in a moment for the sphere, but we can first
note that the drag force is linear in the velocity. Thus, to maintain
a constant velociy we must apply a constant force. The resulting dynamics
is sometimes called *Aristotelian*.

## Flow past a sphere

Next we consider a sphere of radius $R$, centered at the origin, in
an incompressible fluid whose velocity asymptotes to a constant 
value ${\vec u} = U {\hat x}$  far from the sphere, and whose pressure 
asumptotes to a constant value $p_0$.

We write the flow in spherical coordinates $(r,\theta,\phi)$ for which
$r$ is the distance from the center of the sphere; $\theta$ the angle 
from the $x$ axis, and $\phi$ the azimuthal angle away from the $y$ axis 
in the $y-z$ plane. The oncoming flow as wll as he sphere is clearly
independent of $\phi$, and there is no force that would induce
motion in this direction so that we can write the velocity as

$$
	{\vec u} = u_r(r,\theta) {\hat r} + u_{\theta}(r,\theta){\hat \theta}
$$
