# Physics 111a: Introduction to Fluid Mechanics

These are the lecture notes for Physics 111a. They are meant to complement
the class textbook, [Elementary Fluid Mechanics](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/elementary-fluid-dynamics-9780198596790?cc=us&lang=en&). I will probably say other
things during the lecture so you are enouraged to take our own notes as well.

Fluid mechanics is a rich and complex subject. I will not cover all of it, and
certainly the book does not. The book and the course are a starting point for
further explanation (as is true for any class you will take!). Furthermore, if
you ar econfused by a point in the book or the lectures, in addition to
talking to me and to your classmates, I encourage you to seek out additional
discussions in the literature.
