# Dimensional analysis and the Reynolds number

The voscosity is clearly never non-vanishing, but it appears that 
there are cases where we can ignore it. We would like tp understand
this in a more precise way. Saying "the viscosity is small" is insufficient,
as $\nu$ has dimensions of $(length)^2/(time)$, and it makes no sense to say
that a dimensionful quantity is small (a cenimeter is small for 
you but large for a bacterium, etc.)

For the Navier-Stokes equation with ${\vec F}_{ext} = 0$, 
$\nu$ is the only dimensionful parameter. However, if we have a
characteristic length scale $L$ and and time scale $T$, we can
write $Re \equiv T \nu/L^2$ as a dimensionless quantity. 

In the context of fluid motion, let us set ${\vec u} = U {\vec V}$,
where $U$ is a velociyt scale and ${\vec V} \sim {\cal O}(1)$.
We set ${\vec x} = L {\vec \chi}$, and $t = T \tau$, with 
${\vec \chi},\tau \sim {\cal O}(1)$, and $\rho = \rho_0 n$, $n \sim {\cal O}(1)$. 
We further assume that $U = L/T$, or $T = L/U$. Using this scaling,

$$
	\frac{U^2}{L} \left(\partial_{\tau} + {\vec V} \cdot {\vec \nabla}_{\chi} \right){\vec V} 
	= - \frac{1}{L\rho_0 n} {\vec \nabla}_{\chi} p + \frac{U \nu}{L^2} \nabla^2_{\chi} {\vec V} = 0.
$$

Dividing through by $U^2/L$, we find:

$$
	 \left(\partial_{\tau} + {\vec V} \cdot {\vec \nabla}_{\chi} \right){\vec V}
	 = - \frac{1}{n} {\vec \nabla}_{\chi} \left(\frac{p}{U^2\rho_0}\right) + \frac{\nu}{U L} 
	 \nabla^2_{\chi} {\vec V}
$$

if we set $p' = p/(\rho_0 U^2)$ we get:

$$
	 \left(\partial_{\tau} + {\vec V} \cdot {\vec \nabla}_{\chi} \right){\vec V}
	 = - \frac{1}{n} {\vec \nabla}^2_{\chi} p' + \frac{\nu}{U L} 
	 \nabla^2_{\chi} {\vec V}
$$

We define the *Reynolds number* as $Re = \frac{UL}{\nu}$, where $U$ is the 
characeristic velocity of the flow, and $L$ the characteristic scale of the flow.
Thus the viscosity is relativly unimportant when the Reynolds number is large,
and dominates when the Reynolds numbe is small. One way to think about the
Reynolds number is that it measures the relative strength of the "inertial term"
${\vec u} \cdot {\vec \nabla} {\vec u}$ and the "viscous term" $\nu \nabla^2 {\vec u}$.


High and low Reynolds numbers are qualitatively quite different. 
For example, as $Re \to 0$ we can ignore the nonlinear inertial term, and
${\vec u}$ \to - ${\vec u}$ becomes a symmetry of the equations. The flow is
thus *reversible*. Put dye in a viscous fluid and slowly stir it and watch it mix.
Then reverse the direction of stirring, and the dye will return to its original configuration
as long as it is not also diffusing over the time scale of the experiment.

Low Reynolds number flows are important in many biological applications: the flow of blood,
the swimming motion of bacteria and so on. High Reynolds number is important in many
geophysical situations, particularly in ocean and atmospheric dynamics at the right scales.


What $U$ and $L$ means takes a little thought. For example, if the flow has features at
a range of spatial scales, those features have different characteristic Reynolds numbers
attached. In the flow past a cylindr we looked at earlier, the Reynolds number is high
far from the cyliner, particularly in the turbulent wake behind the cyliner, while it
is low in the thin layer close to the boundary where the boundary conditions set the velocity
to zero. Thus in the ocean, turbulent behavior sets in the $\sim few \times 100$ km 
"mesoscale" and below.

Another use of this scaling is that since in dimensionless coordinates only the Reynolds number
appears, we know that if we rescale $L$, $U$, and $\nu$ so that the geometry of a configuration
is the same and the Reynolds number does not change, the geometry of the flow is identical. Thus,
for example, if we wan to understand the behavior of the flow around a full-sized wing, or a boat
in the water, we can do a laboratory experiment with a much smaller wing or model boat if we change 
$L$ and $\nu$ as well so that the Reynolds numbe does not change. For a nice discussion of
the uses of similarity, see {cite:p}`doi:10.1063/PT.3.1258`.
