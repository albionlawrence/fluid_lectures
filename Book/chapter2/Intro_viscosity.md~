# Viscosity: a first pass

The Euler equation captures the behavior of fluids in a variety of situations. It does well in describing
aerodynamics, as we will see, and it does well in describing strongly turbulent flow away from the 
boundaries of the fluid. 

However, experience teaches us that there is an additional frictional force acting inside the fluid, 
when one *shears* the fluid -- sets up a motion with the velocity changing in space.
If one  initiates flow and then does not force the fluid any further, for example, the fluid will
often slowly come to rest (think about stirring your coffee). This force is known as *viscosity*.

Viscosity plays a sort of dual role in flowabout objects. At low velocities, Euler's equations apply,
and for flows that enter from infinity, initially irrotational fluid stays irrotational.

As we increase he velocity of the incoming fluid a turbulent wave develops behind the cylinder
as we can ee here {cite:p}`van1982album`.

Clearly he flow ceases to be irrotational behind the cylinder. Now the presence of viscosity will
allow vorticiy to develop (as we will see). On the other hand, the viscosity is a
strongly subdoninant effect at he scales we're looking at. What is happening is that viscosity becomes
important at the boundary layer surrounding the cylinder. This is because in the presence of vsicosity
we must assume that the tangential velocity vanishes at the sphere. A strong shear thus develops 
in a "boundary layer" near the sphere and the voscisity becomes imporant, allowing the generation 
of vorticity.
