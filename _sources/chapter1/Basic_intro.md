# Basic Equations and Concepts

This week we will introduce some basic concepts and descibe some simple 
fluid behaviors. Much of this, particularly the basic equations, will be
described more rigorously down the line.

The natural place to start is with the question "What is a fluid?". But
before this, unde the assumption that things you think are fluids are 
a proper subset of things that are fluids, let us look at some examples
with behavior we will try to explain.

- A swimming dog [taken from](https://www.doggypure.com/are-labradors-good-swimmers-coats-waterproof/)).

(Not in fact my dog, but a dead ringer for him). Here you can see a kind 
of wavefront bounding a wake arcing out from and behind the dog, 
and choppier water behind him. 

- Capillary waves emanating from a small disturbance:

In this case the surface tension is an important aspect of the dynamics. 
Note the wavelengths decrease with distance.

- "Gravity waves" emanating from a larger disturbance.

As Brad Marston pointed out:

- Generation and movement of vortices. Here is a picture ([from](https://www.universetoday.com/149514/these-bizarre-cloud-patterns-are-von-karmans-vortices-caused-by-the-air-wrapping-around-tall-islands/) of vortices in atmospheric flow (imprinting on the clouds) past islands in the Cape Verde archipelago:

These are all phenomena we will discuss in this course.
